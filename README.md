# odin-recipes

This is a practice site that will demonstrate what I have learned so far in the HTML portion of TheOdinProject. This is a recipe site, where I will show that I am able to create html boilerplate, create lists in html, use headers and paragraph elements effectively, and show that I am able to use git consistently.
